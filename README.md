Relational_Transaction_Anon
===========================

## Introduction
Relational_Transaction_Anon is data anonymization algorithm for Relational and Transaction dataset, proposed by Poulis in his papers[1] in ECML2013 Sep. Poulis gave the pseudocode in his papers, the source code (C++ implement) is not available. 

This repository is just an *open source python implement* for Relational_Transaction_Anon. I implement this algorithm in python for further study. 

### Motivation 
Researches on data privacy have lasted for more than ten years, lots of great papers have been published. However, only a few open source projects are available on Internet[2-3], most open source projects are using algorithms proposed before 2004! Fewer projects have been used in real life. Worse more, most people even don't hear about it. Such a tragedy! 

I decided to make some effort. Hoping these open source repositories can help researchers and developers on data privacy (privacy preserving data publishing).
